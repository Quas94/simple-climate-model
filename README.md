A web application written for the UNSW CCRC (Climate Change Research Centre). Provides a simple interface through which one can manipulate inputs such as carbon dioxide emissions, methane, aerosols, solar variability (and more!) in order to calculate outputs including changes in surface temperature, deep ocean temperature, etc.

Written in HTML5/JavaScript utilising the following dependencies:
- Angular.js (https://angularjs.org/)
- Chartist.js (https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/)

Milestones:
